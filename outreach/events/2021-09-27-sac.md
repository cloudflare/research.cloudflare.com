SAC is Canada's research conference on cryptography, held annually since 1994. From its original emphasis on block ciphers, SAC has evolved into a leading international conference in cryptography covering a range of topics in the field. Cloudflare researchers present signature schemes for existing keys in a talk titled [ZKAttest: Ring and Group Signatures for Existing ECDSA Keys](/publications/Faz-Hernandez2021/).
