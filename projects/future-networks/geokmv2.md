Geo Key Manager v2 is the next step in our journey to provide customers with a secure and flexible way to control the distribution of their private keys by geographic location.

Our original system, [Geo Key Manager](https://research.cloudflare.com/projects/future-networks/geokm/), was launched as a research project in 2017, but as customer needs evolved and our scale increased, we realized that we needed to make significant improvements to provide a better user experience.

Geo Key Manager v2 uses Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) as the underlying cryptography that supports a more flexible access control policies providing a more secure foundation for our system. Learn more about how Geo Key Manager v2 works by exploring the resources below.
