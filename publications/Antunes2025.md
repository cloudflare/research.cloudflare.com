Identifying knee and elbow points in performance curves is a critical task in various domains, including machine learning and system design. These points represent optimal trade-offs between cost and performance, facilitating efficient decision-making and resource allocation. However, accurately determining the knees and elbows in curves poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce Kneeliverse , an open-source library dedicated to knee/elbow point detection. Kneeliverse incorporates a suite of well-established knee-detection algorithms, including Menger, L-method, Kneedle, and DFDT. Additionally, Kneeliverse extends these algorithms to detect multiple knees and elbows in complex curves, employing a recursive approach. Kneeliverse further includes Z-Method, a recently developed algorithm specifically designed for multi-knee detection.
