Operating a large, complex, Internet-based application usually requires measuring the behavior of the application's users. Often the purpose of these measurements is not to build profiles about individual users, but to shed light on overall trends that might point to performance bottlenecks, user-experience issues, bugs, or attack vectors. Recent advances in cryptography, e.g., Prio (NSDI 2017), have made it possible to compute these aggregates without revealing individual measurements to the service provider. This talk will describe the IETF's initial effort to standardize some of these techniques.
